# Experience

## Unreleased Project

**August 2020 - Present**

*Robot Entertainment, Dallas TX*

I'm currently working at Robot Entertainment on an unreleased project. More details when they're available.

## Orcs Must Die! 3

**December 2019 - August 2020**

*Robot Entertainment, Dallas TX*

I worked on Orcs Must Die! 3 with a team of around six other programmers.
Transitioning onto the team, I worked primarily on UI.
As the project progressed and we worked more closely with Stadia's hardware, I took on the graphics engineering work needed to get UE4 up to par with Google's technical requirements.
Along with the graphics engineering work, I also led the charge on a number of nasty bugs that came up along the way.

## ReadySet Heroes

**March 2019 - December 2019**

*Robot Entertainment, Dallas TX*

I worked on ReadySet Heroes and a DLC update that was released a few months after launch.
Along with working on a wide variety of tasks over the life of the project, I owned the UI and graphics/optimization.
This was my first experience as part of the core team on an Unreal project, and I learned the engine architecture and workflows.

## Unreleased Project

**November 2018 - March 2019**

*Vicarious Visions, Albany NY*

I worked on an unreleased project at Vicarious Visions, with a focus on graphics engineering for mobile. Unfortunately I'm not sure what came of it.

## Spyro Reignited Trilogy

**August 2018 - October 2018**

*Vicarious Visions, Albany NY*

I helped Toys For Bob and Sanzaru Games finish the Reignited Trilogy during its final stretch. I was primarily tasked with implementing and maintaining a Spyro 3 minigame, and also helped out more generally fixing bugs and implementing features. I gained more experience using Unreal Engine 4 in a professional setting and got the opportunity to help close another project.

## Angelo Ventresca Associates

**August 2017 - May 2018**

*Angelo Ventresca Associates, Montrose PA*

I built a new website for Angelo Ventresca Associates from the ground up. The client wanted to move to a more modern design with a focus on ease of navigation and mobile compatibility. I worked closely with them to design the site, write the content, deploy the finished product, and update their index in relevant search engines.

## Destiny 2

**July 2017 - August 2018**

**October 2018 - November 2018**

*Vicarious Visions, Albany NY*

I worked on two main projects in the Destiny franchise. The first project managed integrating the Blizzard Launcher into Destiny 2 for the PC release. I worked with protobuf and helped write a lot of the networking code related to rich presence. Later, I worked on content creation tools in C# that integrated tightly into Autodesk Maya and 3DS Max. On this project, I was the platform owner for Maya and helped steer the development philosophy of the tool toward a strong MVVM architecture.

## Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy

**March 2016 - June 2017**

*Vicarious Visions, Albany NY*

I was one of four engineers to work on the N. Sane Trilogy from start to finish, and one of three gameplay engineers on the project. I gained experience working with Vicarious Visions's proprietary Alchemy game engine and worked in many diverse areas including audio, visual scripting, physics, input, and control feel. I gained expertise with the audio engine, and implemented support for multiple PS4 trophy packs as well as all trophies in the game.

## Guitar Hero Live

**March 2015 - December 2015**

*Vicarious Visions, Albany NY*

I worked in collaboration with FreeStyleGames to bring iOS and apple device support to Guitar Hero Live. This was my first foray into professional game development, and I learned a lot about the basics of being a part of a team and engineering practices. I worked with a wide variety of apple devices and learned how to properly develop for them.

## Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute

**August 2013 - December 2016**

*RPI, Troy NY*

I atttended RPI for three and a half years, earning Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Game and Simulation Arts and Sciences. I graduated Summa Cum Laude with a 3.99 GPA. During my time at RPI, I worked with the Rensselaer Center for Open Source (RCOS) and developed open source software over the summer of 2014.
