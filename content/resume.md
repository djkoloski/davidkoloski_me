### Orcs Must Die! 3

- December 2019 - August 2020
- Robot Entertainment, Dallas TX

I worked on Orcs Must Die! 3 with a team of around six other programmers.
Transitioning onto the team, I worked primarily on UI.
As the project progressed and we worked more closely with Stadia's hardware, I took on the graphics engineering work needed to get UE4 up to par with Google's technical requirements.
Along with the graphics engineering work, I also led the charge on a number of nasty bugs that came up along the way.

### ReadySet Heroes

- March 2019 - December 2019
- Robot Entertainment, Dallas TX

I worked on ReadySet Heroes and a DLC update that was released a few months after launch.
Along with working on a wide variety of tasks over the life of the project, I owned the UI and graphics/optimization.
This was my first experience as part of the core team on an Unreal project, and I learned the engine architecture and workflows.

### Unreleased Project (Vicarious Visions)

### Spyro Reignited Trilogy

- Vicarious Visions, Albany NY

I helped Toys For Bob and Sanzaru Games finish the Reignited Trilogy during its final stretch. I was primarily tasked with implementing and maintaining a Spyro 3 minigame, and also helped out more generally fixing bugs and implementing features. I gained more experience using Unreal Engine 4 in a professional setting and got the opportunity to help close another project.

### Angelo Ventresca Associates

- August 2017 - May 2018
- Angelo Ventresca Associates, Montrose PA

I built a new website for Angelo Ventresca Associates from the ground up. The client wanted to move to a more modern design with a focus on ease of navigation and mobile compatibility. I worked closely with them to design the site, write the content, deploy the finished product, and update their index in relevant search engines.

I worked on two main projects in the Destiny franchise. The first project managed integrating the Blizzard Launcher into Destiny 2 for the PC release. I worked with protobuf and helped write a lot of the networking code related to rich presence. Later, I worked on content creation tools in C# that integrated tightly into Autodesk Maya and 3DS Max. On this project, I was the platform owner for Maya and helped steer the development philosophy of the tool toward a strong MVVM architecture.

### Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy

- March 2016 - June 2017
- Vicarious Visions, Albany NY

I was one of four engineers to work on the N. Sane Trilogy from start to finish, and one of three gameplay engineers on the project. I gained experience working with Vicarious Visions's proprietary Alchemy game engine and worked in many diverse areas including audio, visual scripting, physics, input, and control feel. I gained expertise with the audio engine, and implemented support for multiple PS4 trophy packs as well as all trophies in the game.

### Guitar Hero Live

- March 2015 - December 2015
- Vicarious Visions, Albany NY

I worked in collaboration with FreeStyleGames to bring iOS and apple device support to Guitar Hero Live.

I worked with a wide variety of apple devices and learned how to properly develop for them.
